## Local environment setup

> This is not tested!

You can create a local `conda` environment using 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

By default it will create an environment named `qiime2`, and has the exact copy of the packages installed in the course's provided environemnt.

> The configuration file `environment.yml` was generated by:
>
> ```bash
> conda env export --from-history | grep -v "^prefix: " > environment-pig.yml
> ```
>
> Combining the channel information showed in `conda env export`, and modified the `name` accordingly.

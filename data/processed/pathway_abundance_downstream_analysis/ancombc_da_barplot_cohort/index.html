        <p>Notes on interpreting plots with taxonomic feature identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If taxonomic labels are used to identify features, the feature labels
            (y-axis labels) in each plot represent the most specific named taxonomic level
            associated with that feature.</li>

            <li>Hover over the bars in plots to see the full taxonomic label of each
            feature identifier and information about its differential abundance relative
            to the reference.</li>

            <li>Feature identifiers (y-axis labels) that are followed by an asterisk
            (<code>*</code>) represent instances of a duplicated taxonomic name at the
            level displayed in the feature identifier. The number preceding the feature
            identifiers in these cases is used only for unique identification in the
            current figure. It is not taxonomically meaningful, and it won't be
            consistent across visualizations.</li>
